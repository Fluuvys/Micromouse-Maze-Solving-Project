# Micromouse Project by Nguyễn Hoàng Minh Giang

This repository contains the full code for our Micromouse project using Arduino and Mackorone's Simulator the MMS (Micromouse Simulator) for testing and simulating our algorithm. The project demonstrates the implementation of a Micromouse that can navigate a maze using sensors, encoders, and motor control.

## Introduction

The Micromouse project aims to build a small robotic vehicle that can autonomously navigate through a maze. The robot uses Arduino for control and various sensors to detect its surroundings. The code provided in this repository allows the Micromouse to move straight, turn right, and turn left while adjusting its movement based on feedback from encoders.

## Project Structure
